# TextClassification
This is the text classification project. Coded it from scratch ie using the gaussionNB from scratch. I have also used other classifiers, like decision trees and random forests (will be doing Neural Networks too soon), too see the accuracy of classification.

Text Classification Advanced: 
Classifies using Sklearn inbuilt classifier, gaussian naive bayes. It is a multi_class 
text classifier, as seen in the mini_newsgroups dataset, it classifies in 20 different 
classes each piece of news article. I also used it with the DecisionTreeClassifier, 
and as expected it performed Very Very quickly and very well on this dataset

Text Classification Advanced - Copy 1 :
This is own implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes with log normal prob. It is also 
multi_class text classifier. It is slow tho. So slow that it takes about 5 seconds to 
classify each example. That comes at high precision and f1-score so I am happy.

Text Classification Advanced - Optimized :
It is slightly more complicated and faster version of above.
